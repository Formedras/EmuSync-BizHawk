# EmuSync

EmuSync-BizHawk, based on bizhawk-co-op by TestRunner, is a Lua script for BizHawk that uses system or network messages to modify the experience of certain games using the BizHawk emulator. bizhawk-co-op was originally made specifically for cooperative gameplay over network; EmuSync seeks to allow for other experiences, and is designed specifically with Mixer Interactive in mind. Cooperative play without Mixer Interactive, in the same vein as bizhawk-co-op, is intended to continue to be one of these experiences.
